# ReadingLogFiles

A log file contains details about the activities taking place when a software system or program is executing. These occurrences include errors, user requests, bugs, etc. These user-related facts can be further analyzed by developers to identify future issues with the system, set newer, better solutions in place, and enhance the overall design. Log files can provide a wealth of information about the security of the system, which aids developers in making the system or application better.

A log file's entries often follow a format or pattern. Any programming language may be taken into consideration to do analysis on these log files. However, this is primarily for using Python to determine the number of lines with an "ERROR" status. The second file also prints out the fastest transaction and the average time in ms.

In spite of this, the process' underlying philosophy is the same across all programming languages. To complete the necessary task, the Python code can be readily converted to any other programming language.
