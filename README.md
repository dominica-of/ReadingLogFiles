# ReadingLogFiles
A log file's entries often follow a format or pattern. Any programming language may be taken into consideration to do analysis on these log files. However, this is primarily for using Python to determine the number of lines with an "ERROR" status. The second file also prints out the fastest transaction and the average time in ms.

In spite of this, the process' underlying philosophy is the same across all programming languages. To complete the necessary task, the Python code can be readily converted to any other programming language.
