# ReadingLogFiles
This script is for printing out the number of lines with "ERROR" status in a log file using Python. 

A log file contains details about the activities taking place when a software system or program is executing. These occurrences include errors, user requests, bugs, etc. Developers can further scan these details about the use to figure out potential problems with the system, implement newer and better solutions, and improve the overall design. Log files can provide a wealth of information about the security of the system, which aids developers in making the system or application better.

A log file's entries often follow a format or pattern. Any programming language may be taken into consideration to do analysis on these log files. However, this is primarily for using Python to determine the number of lines with anÂ "ERROR" status. In spite of this, the process' underlying philosophy is the same across all programming languages. To complete the necessary task, the Python code can be readily converted to any other programming language.
